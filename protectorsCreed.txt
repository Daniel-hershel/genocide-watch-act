My grandparents are holocaust survivors. They are not the only ones, nor is the holocaust they survived, in which two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe were exterminated, the only holocaust to happen. We are the survivors of genocide and it is our human vocation to align ourselves with all those who have or are experiencing life under the reigns of oppression.  My family survived, because a gentile family risked their lives and hid my grandparents in a potato hole in their backyard. precarious class    I have grown up believing and now more then ever, that as Jews, we have a responsibility to be the front guard of any watch for Genocide, or the steps that lead to it. To those ends I am creating a space to collect and connect the possible steps that are associated with and come together to create the conditions under which genocide is able to happen.


As well as some ideas collected by us as a community, as to how we can confront these conditions when they appear, and protect-stand guard the people who are targeted by these steps towards genocide.

Protectors Creed

I will seek out the people being targeted, the precarious class, and 
I will seek to serve their well being, whether it be a lingering smile, an intervention into any physical or emotional harm that would come to them by any agents of the genocide or it tentacles of propaganda.
I will reinforce the humanity of any people and all people who's humanity is questioned or attacked.

I will not will not allow the subjugation of any humans

I can do this by actively engaging in the world to make myself aware
and most importantly to listen, and learn to listen better to people's experience


We will not allow the subjugation of any humans.
We will


I will

I will not

I can

If people need help
I will

We will

We will not

(maybe the program takes the 'i will' 'i will not' and cycles them into additional 'we will' statements)
